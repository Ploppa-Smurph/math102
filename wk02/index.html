<h1>Math 102 wk 02: 1.05 Quadratic Equations & 1.06</h1>
<h2>1.05 Quadratic Equations</h2>
<b>Quadratic Equations</b> - equation written <b><i>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</i></b> where a, b, & c are real numbers and <i>a != 0</i>

<b>Zero-product principle - if product of 2 albebraic expressions is zero (0), then at least one of the factors is equal to zero. If <i>AB = 0, then A = 0 or B = 0</i></b>
    * product is multiplication *

<b>Solving an Equation by Factoring</b>
    1) If necessary, rewrite the equation in the general form <i>ax^2 + bx + c = 0 by moving all terms to one side, leaving zero on the other side.</i>
    2) Factor completely
    3) Apply the zero-product principle, setting each factor containing a variable equal to zero.
    4) Solve the equations from step three.
    5) Check the solutions in the original equation

    ex: Solve by factoring
        3x^2 - 9x = 0           -- 1st - this equation is already written in 'general form' 
        3x(x - 3) = 0           -  2nd - factor the equation when possible; factor 3x out of both 
        3x = 0 and (x - 3) = 0  -- 3rd - set each factor containing a variable equal to 0 
        x = 0, x = 3            -- 4th - solve the equations from step three

    ex02: Solve by factoring
        2x^2 + x = 1              -- 1st - write in standard form
        2x^2 + x - 1 = 0          -- 2nd - factor the equation when possible
        2x^2 + 2x - 1x - 1 = 0    -- 2nd pt 2 - factor with <i>A(C) method</i>, 2(-1) = -2, what 2 factors can give us -2 and end up with a 1x in the center?
                                            in this example -2, we can get -2 by multiplying 2 * -1, the result of if you add those together is 1. so this solves for this example
        2x(x + 1) - 1(x + 1) = 0  -- 2nd pt 3 - we then factor again using grouping (front items and back items to find a more simple factor)
        (x + 1)(2x - 1) = 0       -- 2nd pt 4 - factor even further by grouping
        x + 1 = 0; 2x - 1 = 0     -- 3rd set each factor group with variables to 0
        x = -1; x = 1/2 (0.5)     -- 4th solve for the equations from step three 
     
<b>Square Root Property</b> - if <i>u</i> is an algebraic expression and <i>d</i> is a nonzero real number then, 
             <i>u^2 = d</i> has exactly 2 solutions: 
             If <i>u^2 = d</i>, then <i>u = sqrt d</i> or <i>u = - sqrt d</i>
                Equivalently, If <i>u^2 = d</i>, then <i>u = +- sqrt d</i>

    ex: 3x^2 - 21 = 0
        3x^2 = 21 
        x^2 = 7
        x = +- sqrt 7

    ex02: 5x^2 + 45 = 0
          5x^2 = -45
          x^2 = -9
          x = +- sqrt 9 
          x = +- 3
          
    ex03: (x + 5)^2 = 11
          x + 5 = [+-] (sqrt 11)
          x = -5 [+-] (sqrt 11)

<b>Quadratic Formula</b> - can be used to find the solutions of quadratic equation in general form (<i>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</i> if <i>a != 0</i>)  
    x = (-b [+-] (sqrt b^2 - 4ac) // 2a)

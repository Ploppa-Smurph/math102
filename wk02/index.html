<h1>Math 102 wk 02: 1.05 Quadratic Equations & 1.06</h1>
<h2>1.05 Quadratic Equations</h2>
<b>Quadratic Equations</b> - equation written <b><i>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</i></b> where a, b, & c are real numbers and <i>a != 0</i>
<b>Zero-product principle - if product of 2 albebraic expressions is zero (0), then at least one of the factors is equal to zero. If <i>AB = 0, then A = 0 or B = 0</i></b>
    * product is multiplication *

<b>Solving an Equation by Factoring</b>
    1) If necessary, rewrite the equation in the general form <i>ax^2 + bx + c = 0 by moving all terms to one side, leaving zero on the other side.</i>
    2) Factor completely
    3) Apply the zero-product principle, setting each factor containing a variable equal to zero.
    4) Solve the equations from step three.
    5) Check the solutions in the original equation

    ex: Solve by factoring
        3x^2 - 9x = 0           -- 1st - this equation is already written in 'general form' 
        3x(x - 3) = 0           -  2nd - factor the equation when possible; factor 3x out of both 
        3x = 0 and (x - 3) = 0  -- 3rd - set each factor containing a variable equal to 0 
        x = 0, x = 3            -- 4th - solve the equations from step three

    ex02: Solve by factoring
        2x^2 + x = 1            -- 1st - write in standard form
        2x^2 + x - 1 = 0         -- 2nd - factor the equation when possible

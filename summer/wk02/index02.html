<h3>02.01 - Basic Functions and Their Graphs</h3>
<b>Relation</b>: any set of ordered pair

<b>Domain</b>: set of all first values, x-values

<b>Range</b>: set of all second values, y-values

<b>Function</b>: relation in which each value in domain corresponds to exactly one value in range (for every x there is only 1 y)
        ** if y-value is repeated then the x's must be different **

<b>Functional Notation</b>: f(x)

<b>Vertical Line Test</b>: if vertical line intersects graph in more than one place, it is NOT a function

<b>Interval vs Set-Builder Notation</b>:
    - Interval:  <i>[-3, -2]</i>
    - Set-Build: <i>{x| -3 <= x <= -2}</i>

<b>Zero of a Function</b>: x-value for which <b><i>f(x)</i> = 0</b>

<b>y-intercept</b>: where graph crosses y-axis;
    ex: if y-intercept = 3; then <b><i>f(0)=3</i></b>

** Functions CAN HAVE MULTIPLE X-intercepts, but ONLY ONE Y-intercept **

<h2>Day 03: 02.03 - Linear Functions and Slope</h2>
<h3>02.03 - Linear Functions and Slope</h3>
<b>Slope</b> - measure how steep a line is; ratio of vertical change to horizontal change 
    ** <b>Rise / Run</b> **

<b>4 types of Slope</b>:
    <i><b>Positive</b></i>: line rises from left to right
    <i><b>Negative</b></i>: line falls from left to right
    <i><b>Zero Slope</b></i>: horizontal line
    <i><b>Undefined Slope</b></i>: vertical line

<b>Point Slope Equation</b>:
    <b><i>y - y(sub1) = m(x - x(sub1))</i></b>   -- where x(sub1) & y(sub1) are points on a line

<b>Slope Intercept Form</b>:
    <b><i>y = mx + b</i></b>   -- where 'm' represents the slope & 'b' represents the y-intercept

<b>Graphing y=mx + b using slope and y-intercept</b>
    <i>1) plot the y-intercept; (0, b)</i>
    <i>2) start at y-intercept and use 'm' to determine rise and run</i>
    <i>3) draw line through the points</i>

<b>Equation of a Horizontal Line</b>: <i>y = b</i> Slope Zero -- no x-value, does not cross x-axis

<b>Equation of a Vertical Line</b>: Slope Undefined -- no y-value

<b>General Form of an Equation</b>:
    <i><b>Ax + By + C = 0</b></i>  -- both 'A' and 'B' cannot be 0

<b>Using Intercepts to Graph Ax + By + C = 0</b>
    <i>1) find x-intercept. Let y=0 and sovle for x. Plot the point.</i>
    <i>2) find y-intercept. Let x=0 and solve for y. Plot the point.</i>
    <i>3) draw line through the two points.</i>

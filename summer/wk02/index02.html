<h2>Day 01: 02.01 Basic Functions and Their Graphs</h2>
<h3>02.01 Basic Functions and Their Graphs</h3>
<b>Relation</b>: any set of ordered pair

<b>Domain</b>: set of all first values, x-values

<b>Range</b>: set of all second values, y-values

<b>Function</b>: relation in which each value in domain corresponds to exactly one value in range (for every x there is only 1 y)
        ** if y-value is repeated then the x's must be different **

<b>Functional Notation</b>: f(x)

<b>Vertical Line Test</b>: if vertical line intersects graph in more than one place, it is NOT a function

<b>Interval vs Set-Builder Notation</b>:
    - Interval:  <i>[-3, -2]</i>
    - Set-Build: <i>{x| -3 <= x <= -2}</i>

<b>Zero of a Function</b>: x-value for which <b><i>f(x)</i> = 0</b>

<b>y-intercept</b>: where graph crosses y-axis;
    ex: if y-intercept = 3; then <b><i>f(0)=3</i></b>

** Functions CAN HAVE MULTIPLE X-intercepts, but ONLY ONE Y-intercept **

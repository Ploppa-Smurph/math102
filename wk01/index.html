<h1>Math 102 wk 01 - Section 01.02 Linear Equations and Rational Equations</h1>
<pre>
<h2>Linear Equations</h2>
   <b>Linear Equation in One variable</b> - equation that can be written <i>Ax + B = 0</i>, if <i>A</i> & <i>B</i> are real numbers and <i>A</i> != 0  
       the value that solves the equation is a <b><i>solution</i></b> or <b><i>??root??</i></b>

   <b>Solution Set</b> - set of all solutions that satisfy the equation
    
   <b>Equivalent Equations</b> - 2 or more equations that have the same solution set

<h3>Solving Linear Equations</h3>
    1) Simplify algebraic expresson on each side by removing grouping symbols and combining like terms
    2) Collect all variables on one side and numbers or constant terms on the other side
    3) Isolate the variable and solve
    4) Check the proposed solution in the original equation

  ex: 4x + 5 = 29
         - 5   -5

      4x = 24
      /4   /4

      x = 6  

  ex02: 4(2x+1) = 29 + 3(2x - 5) 
         8x + 4 = 29 + 6x - 15
             2x = 10
              x = 5   

  ** in this example 'clear the equation of fractions' by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator **           
  ex03: (x-3)/4 = 5/14 - (x+5)/7    -- use LCD of 28 to multiply all items
         7(x-3) = 10 - 4(x+5)
        7x - 21 = 10 - 4x - 20
            11x = 11
              x = 1

<h2>Rational Equations</h2>
    <b>Rational Equation</b> - contains one or more rational expressions; they have fractions with a variable in the denominator 

  ex: 5/2x = 17/18 - 1/3x
  
  
  ex02: x/x-2 = 2/x-2 - 2/3

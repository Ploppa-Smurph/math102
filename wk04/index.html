<h1>Math 102 wk 04</h1>
<h2>Section 2.1 - Basics of Functions and Their Graphs</h2>
<pre>
<b>Relation</b>: any set of ordered pairs

<b>Domain</b>: set of all first values of ordered pairs (x values)

<b>Range</b>: set of all second values of odered pairs (y values)

<b>Function</b>: relation in which each value in the domain corresponds to exaclty one value in the range. 
       -- a function can have a y-value repeated as long as it does not have an x-value repeating

determine whether each relation is a function or not.
ex: {(1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (5,8)} - not a function, this relation is Not a function

ex02: {(1,2), (3,4), (6,5), (8,5)} - function, this relation is a function

<b>Independent Variable</b>: x-value, can be assigned from any domain value (the x)

<b>Dependent Variable</b>: y-value, dependent on the x-value

ex: <i>y = -.016^2 + 93x + 85</i> in this example x is the number of years worked at a company, 
                                    y is the total number of sick days earned
 
** NOT all equations are functions -- if more than 1 value is found for x, then the equation is NOT a function    

ex: <i>2x + y = 6</i>
       y = -2x + 6           -- Function

ex02: <i>x^2 + y^2 = 1</i>
       y^2 = 1 - x^2 
       y = +- sqrt(1 - x)    -- not a function

Functions are normally named with letters <i>f, g, h, F, G, H</i>. 'f' is most common       

<b><i>f(x)</i></b> is functional notation (NOT f * x)
   - <i>f(x)</i> represents the value of a function at that particular x-value
   - <i>f(x)</i> an y represent the same thing, they are just a different way of writing the same thing

Evaluate <i>f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 7</i> for the following:
ex: <i>f(-5)</i>
    f(-5) = (-5)^2 - 2(-5) + 7
    f(-5) = 25 + 10 + 7
    f(-5) = 42                   -- this is the solution... the ordered pair would be (-5, 42)

ex02: <i>f(x + 4)</i>
      f(x + 4) = (x + 4)^2 - 2(x + 4) + 7
      f(x+4) = x^2 + 4x + 4x + 16 - 2x - 8 + 7
      f(x+4) = x^2 + 6x + 15    -- this is the solution 

ex03: <i>f(-x)</i>
      f(-x) = (-x)^2 - 2(-x) + 7 
      f(-x) = x^2 + 2x + 7

<b>Linear Function</b>: function whose graph is a straight line
<i>f(x) = mx + b</i> -- linear function form

ex: graph function <i>f(x) = 2x</i> and <i>g(x) = 2x - 3</i> on the same graph; select integers from -2 to 2.
     -- remember <i>f(x)</i> is the same as <i>y (the range value, also the dependent variable)</i>

we would find our order pairs
  <i>f(x) = 2x</i>     
  f(-2) = 2(-2); f(-2) = -4; (-2, -4) 
  f(-1) = 2(-1); f(-1) = -2; (-1, -2)  
  f(0)  = 2(0);  f(0) = 0;   (0 , 0)
  f(1)  = 2(1);  f(1) = 2;   (1, 2)
  f(2)  = 2(2);  f(2) = 4;   (2, 4)

  <i>g(x) = 2x - 3</i>
  g(-2) = 2(-2) - 3; g(-2) = -7; (-2, -7) 
  g(-1) = 2(-1) - 3; g(-1) = -5; (-1, -5) 
  g(0) = 2(0) - 3; g(0) = -3;    (0, -3)
  g(1) = 2(1) - 3; g(1) = -1;    (1, -1)
  g(2) = 2(2) - 3; g(2) = 1;     (2, 1)

<b>Vertical Line Test</b>: if vertical line intersects a graph in more than one place the graph is NOT a function

<b>** When Graphing **</b>
  - closed dot indicates that the graph does not extend beyond that point and that the point IS included in the graph.
  - open dot indicates the graph does not extend beyond this point and the point is NOT included in the graph.
  - arrow indicates the graph extends indefinitely in that direction

<b>Set-Builder Notation: </b>  
[-3, -2] is an example of 'Interval Notation'. 
- the brackets [] show that the point is included

Set-Builder notation looks like: 
{x | -3 <= x <= -2}

if the 'interval notation' uses () 'parenthesis' instead of [] 'brackets' the 'set-builder' notation will look like
{x | -3 < x < -2}         - the parenthesis will not include the equal to aspect

using graphs to find the domain and range. 
  remember  domain = x-value; range = y-value
go from left to right and identify the domains

Domain = left -> right the 'width' of the graph
Range = down -> up the 'height' of the graph 

set = {}

<b>Zeros of a Function</b>: x-value for which <i>f(x) = 0</i>

<b>y-intercept</b>: where a graph crosses the y-axis. 
   If the function has a 'y-intercept' at 3, it is written <i>f(0) = 3</i>

a function can have more than one x-intercept but at most one y-intercept   
<h2>Section 2.2 - More Functions and Their Graphs</h2>
<b>Functions</b>
 - Increasing if it rises from left to right 
 - Decreasing if it falls from left to right 
 - Constant - does not change from left to right

 Functions can be both Increasing and Decreasing (at different intervals)

 <b>Relative Minimum</b>:

 <b>Relative Maximum</b>:

 <b>Even Function</b>: if <i>f(-x) = f(x)</i> 
      -- the right side of the equation does not change if <i>'x'</i> is replaced with <i>'-x'</i>

 <b>Odd Functions</b>: if <i>f(-x) = -f(x)</i>
      -- every term on the right side of the equation changes it's sign if <i>'x'</i> is replaced with <i>'-x'</i>

ex: <i>f(x) = x^2 + 6</i>     -- subustitue '-x' to see if the equation is even or odd
       f(-x) = (-x)^2 + 6
       f(-x) = x^2 + 6        -- even             

ex02: <i>g(x) = 7x^3 - x</i>
      g(-x) = 7(-x)^3 - (-x)  -- odd 
      g(-x) = - 7x^3 + x      -- odd

ex03: <i>h(x) = x^5 + 1</i>
      h(-x) = -x^5 + 1  
      h(-x) = -x^5 + 1        -- neither even or odd 

Even functions are symmetric with respect to the y-axis

Odd functions are symmetric with respect to the origin

<b>Piecewise Function</b>: defined by two (or more) equations over a specified domain

ex: cell phone company has a plan: $20 per month for 60 minutes and $0.40 for each additional minute.
    <i>write an equation, let 'C' represent the monthly cost and 't' the number of minutes</i>

    <i>C(t)= 20 </i>                    - if 0<= t <= 60
    <i>C(t) = 20 + 0.40(t - 60)</i>     - if 't' > 60

 a) C(30)  = 20
 
 b) C(100)
     20 + 0.40(100 - 60)
     20 + 0.40(40)
     20 + 16
     36

 c) C(40)  = 20

 d) C(80)
    20 + 0.40(80 - 60)
    20 + 0.40(20)
    20 + 8
    28
